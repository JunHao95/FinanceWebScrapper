# Examples:
# '0 14 * * 1-5'  # 2 PM UTC, weekdays

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Email not sending**: Check Gmail app password setup
2. **API rate limits**: Reduce ticker count or add delays
3. **Timeout errors**: Increase `timeout-minutes` in workflow
4. **Missing artifacts**: Check if job completed successfully

### Debug Steps:
1. Run manual test workflow first
2. Check logs for specific error messages
3. Verify all secrets are set correctly
4. Test with single ticker before full list

## üí∞ GitHub Actions Limits

- **Free tier**: 2,000 minutes/month
- **Typical usage**: ~10-15 minutes per run
- **Daily runs**: ~5 hours/month (well within limits)
- **Storage**: Artifacts count toward storage quota
